# DNN-over-Unlabelled-data


Based on a small labelled and large unlabeled training set, the system will predict agency and sociality for happy moments in the test set. 
- Agency label (0 or 1, where 1 indicates that the individual who created the text was actively participating as an agent) and 
- social label will be the classes to forecast for each text (0 or 1, where 1 means that the text describes a social activity).

Files Description 
- EDA on the TRAIN and TEST Data Set.ipynb : “Pre-processing TRAIN and TEST data” and store the resultant using ‘Pickle’.
- Baseline Classifier.ipynb : Both the labels (social, agency) were individually classified using "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)", "Logistic Regression", "Linear SVC", "Random Forest", "K-Nearest Neignours", "Hyper tuned Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Model" and "Hyper tuned Logistic Regression Model".
